# Distribution GAN

This example demonstrates how to use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to learn the distribution of a dataset. The GAN is trained on data generated from a `pymc` model and the results are visualized using `matplotlib`.

## Running the Example

To run the example, execute the following command:

```bash
python3 examples/distribution_gan.py
```

This will train the GAN and generate a plot of the real and fake data distributions in `examples/pymc_distribution.jpg`.
